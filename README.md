# Neural Network Project
Authors: Bruce Choe, Daniel Enriquez, Michael Stepzinski?, Erik Marsh?

Goal: Create a Natural Language Processing (NLP) System to perform sentiment analysis on finanacial earning calls. 
      See if sentiment of earning calls can reasonably predict company performance, compare results to historical data. 
      
Specs: Develop NLP System using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) approach?
